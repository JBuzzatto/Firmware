quick notes for tomorow:

**The mixer seems to be obligatory. I seems that the actuator commands are fired by the mixer module/app/whatever (check!!!)

**the uORB msg/topics are in Firmware/msg before build.
after build some script/whatever copyes/modify it to /Firmware/build/px4_sitl_default/uORB/topics/

**all information from all modules comes from messages trough subscription/publishing

**the att ctrl module (as any other module) will probably never send a message or information directly to other module.
what it does is publish it on a topic on uORB. then any other module can access it.
Even though it is good for flexibility, it makes it hard to track the flow of information in a system.

**you will probably have to check on the 'build' folder to look for the running and/or built modules and check
which topics they publish and subscribe to. (is there no documentation for that???)


## 1 The flight stack or flight control diagram follows what is displaced at:
 - https://dev.px4.io/master/en/concept/architecture.html#flight-stack

#The thing that I was confuse the most is the flow of information, but it seems that the flow of information follows the diagram of the figure
#After the attitude/rate controllers (the last called control block), its outputs are passed down to the mixer and them to the actuator drivers.
#On the following, I will attempt to describe this two last blocks, mixer and actuator divers, stressing the flow of information as well.

#*This is for the posix build (px4 sitl default)

**- Mixer

The mixer module, before build, is not together with the other modules. it is hidden on the lib folder, together with of other useful libraries.
#after built located at: Firmware/build/px4_sitl_default/??? (notice it is also part of NuttX systems)
#before built located at: Firmware/src/lib/
	- There are two folder related to mixer there:
		mixer/
		mixer_module/
